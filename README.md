# Coronavirus Map

Four team members of TTP-Team-2 collaborated to make a user oriented website with signup, login, profile, logout, and a home page that displays pins of zip codes where people have been confirmed positive for coronavirus. Users can sign up with their information, such as username, password, age, ZIP/Postal Code, symptoms, and if they've been tested (if so, positive/negative). Once completed, the user will redirect to login. Next, users can view a Google Map on the Home View with pins centered at the location of ZIP/Postal codes, therefore, the users can remain anonymous. Users can tell where clusters or hotspots are forming based on the density of pins in a given region.
